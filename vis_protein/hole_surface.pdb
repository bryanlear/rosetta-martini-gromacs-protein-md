 *** Program sph_process (replacing sphqpt) ***
 Reads a .sph file produced by hole
 option SPHPDB which contains sphere centre info,
 and processes it to a either dot surface or a number of other options
 either as a dot or grid representation

 sph_process works on .sph file produced by PDBSPH option in hole.
 This file is then converted either to:
 (a) a dot or spaghetti surface - qpt format 
 (b) an .sos input file for the sos_triangle program to 
     finally make a solid surface 
 (c) PEG option (to be written)
 
 Usage:  sph_process (-qpt) (-nocen) (-sos) ...  input_file output_file
 options: 
  -qpt:  produce a dot surface to qpt file (default)
  -sos:  produce a .sos file for use by sos_triangle 
  -dotden D: use a dot density of D used by -qpt and-sos options
             D should be between 5 and 30 the higher the
             value the more dots. Default is 10. 
  -nocen: do not produce centre line (-qpt only) 
  -spaghetti (X): produce a spaghetti rather than a dot 
                  surface (for -qpt only 
                  controlled by X the grid density 
                  A X value of 2.0 will produce a rather
                   rough surface, 1.3 a rather dense surface
                  default is 1.8 a reasonable compromise.
                  N.B. procedure takes much longer than  dot surface.
  -rover Rover: use an override radius of Rover angs.
              every sphere read will be assigned radius R
              instead of individual radii
  -ignore_small (Rignore): ignore any spheres with a radius
                           less than Rignore. If argument
                           found then a default 1.15angs
                           used unless a value is specified
  -colour (Rlow Rmid): produce a coloured surface
                       surface will be 
                       red for pore radii < Rlow 
                       green for Rlow < pore radii < Rmid
                       blue  for pore radii > Rmid
                       default Rlow = 1.15 angs
                       default Rmid = 2.30 angs
                       (for connolly use effective radius
                        of slab rather than pore radius
  -color same as -colour for yanks
  -peg Rplus Rminus ThetaPEG ThetaNON
       Graphical output - specify with -sosout for .sph file
                          with accessible spheres in it
                          defaults to drawing sections to qpt
