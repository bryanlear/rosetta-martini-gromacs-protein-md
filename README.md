## Project Overview

This repository contains a multi-scale computational workflow designed to substantiate the pathogenicity (or lack thereof) of variants classified as pathogenic by my own automated ACMG/AMP Bayesian variant classification pipeline: [VarClass](https://www.varclass.com). 

The main target is to provide a mechanistic basis for variants previously classified as pathogenic within the pipeline's Bayesian scoring framework.

## Methodology

### Structural (Rosetta)
Initial protein structures are processed to introduce point mutations and minimize local energy.
